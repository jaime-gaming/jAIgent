# Security Policy

## Supported versions

**Supported versions:** 0.5.x (current beta). Older minors (0.1–0.4) are no longer supported and will not receive security patches. Upgrade with `pip install --upgrade jaigent`.

| Version | Released | Supported | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.5.x | 2026-09-11 | ✅ | Current beta (0.5.6). Auth, orange jAI chrome, session catalogue, binaries. |
| 0.4.x | 2026-08-18 | ❌ | End of support. Use 0.5.x or later for security patches. |
| 0.3.x | 2026-08-18 | ❌ | End of support. Use 0.5.x or later for security patches. |
| 0.2.x | 2026-08-18 | ❌ | End of support. Use 0.5.x or later for security patches. |
| 0.1.x | 2026-08-18 | ❌ | End of support. Use 0.5.x or later for security patches. |

Fixes land on `main` first and are released as patch releases for 0.5.x. Older versions (0.1–0.4) are not backported.

### Supported Python versions

jaigent supports **every Python that upstream still supports**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and
3.13. CI runs the full suite against all four on Linux, and against 3.10 and 3.13 on
macOS and Windows. The standalone binaries bundle their own interpreter, so they work with no
Python installed at all.

Upgrade with `pip install --upgrade jaigent`, or re-run the installer script, then
confirm with `jaigent --version`. `jaigent doctor` will tell you if anything is wrong.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** through
[GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/jaime-gaming/jaigent/security/advisories/new)
rather than opening a public issue.

Include what you found, how to reproduce it, and what an attacker could achieve.
You can expect an initial response within a few days.

Particularly interested in:

- **Sandbox escapes** — any way to make a file tool read or write outside the workspace.
- **Shell blocklist bypasses** that go beyond the documented limits of `run_command`.
- **Key leakage** — any path where an API key reaches stdout, a log, or disk.
- **Gateway authentication flaws** — any way to reach `jaigent serve` without a valid
  key, to recover a key from `keys.json`, or to make one caller see another's data.

## Threat model

Knowing what jaigent does and does not defend against will save you time.

**Defended:**

- File tools cannot leave the workspace. Relative traversal, absolute paths and
  symlinks pointing outside are rejected before any I/O happens.
- Shell execution is absent from the toolset unless explicitly enabled.
- Provider API keys are read from the environment, a git-ignored `.env`, or
  `~/.jaigent/secrets.env` (owner-only, written by `jaigent auth` / `init`).
  They are masked in all output including `jaigent config`.
  `jaigent settings set` refuses to store a secret at all.
- Gateway keys (`jgt-…`) are stored only as SHA-256 hashes, in a file created with
  owner-only permissions. The plain text is shown once, at creation. Comparison is
  constant-time, so timing cannot reveal a valid prefix.
- `jaigent serve` binds `127.0.0.1` by default and refuses to start with no keys
  unless you pass `--no-auth` explicitly. `--no-auth` on an interface other than
  loopback is refused outright: requests run with approvals forced to `auto`, so
  an unauthenticated gateway on a reachable address is remote control of the
  workspace. Bind loopback, or create a key.
- Skills and custom commands are prompt text, never code. Loading one cannot execute
  anything; it can only add words to the conversation.
- A failing tool cannot crash a run or leak a stack trace to the user; errors are
  returned to the model as text.
- Every file the agent modifies is snapshotted first, so an unwanted change can be
  reverted with `jaigent undo`. The snapshot is taken before the approval prompt, so
  a change you approved and then regretted is recoverable too. Restoring cannot
  write outside the workspace: a `../..` or absolute path in a hand-edited
  checkpoint index is skipped rather than followed.
- Commands are screened against a blocklist covering recursive deletes of `/` or `~`,
  raw disk writes, filesystem formats, fork bombs, `sudo`, piping a download into a
  shell, force pushes, reads of `~/.ssh` and `/etc/shadow`, and machine shutdown.
  Screening runs on a whitespace-normalised, lower-cased form of the command, so
  `RM  -RF  /` is treated the same as `rm -rf /`.
- Provider failures cannot silently leak your prompt to an unintended provider: the
  fallback chain only includes providers for which *you* have configured a key.
- Dependencies are audited by `pip-audit` and the source by `bandit` on every CI run,
  across all supported Python versions. The runtime dependency list is two packages
  (`httpx`, `rich`) and kept deliberately small.
- Release binaries are built by CI from a tagged commit, never from a developer's
  machine, and published with SHA-256 checksums. Both installer scripts verify the
  checksum and abort on a mismatch.
- `fetch_page` refuses to reach the local machine or a private network. Cloud
  metadata endpoints (`169.254.169.254` and friends), loopback, link-local, private
  and reserved ranges are all rejected. The hostname is resolved first and every
  address it maps to is checked, so a public-looking name pointed at `127.0.0.1`
  is caught too, and each redirect hop is re-checked so a public URL cannot bounce
  inward. This matters because the model may be acting on instructions from a page
  it just read.
- Files containing credentials — the `.env` written by `jaigent init` and the
  gateway key store — are created with owner-only permissions, set before the first
  byte is written rather than fixed up afterwards.
- The update check is read-only and contacts nothing but the GitHub releases API. It
  sends no identifying information, and `jaigent update` never installs anything
  without an explicit command (and, on a terminal, a confirmation).

**Not defended — by design:**

- **Prompt injection from fetched content.** `fetch_page` returns untrusted text from
  the open web. A malicious page can try to instruct the model. Content is stripped and
  truncated, never executed, but do not combine `--allow-shell` with untrusted browsing.
- **A model you enabled the shell for.** `--allow-shell` grants command execution in the
  workspace. The blocklist prevents accidents, not a determined adversary.
- **What the model chooses to send.** File contents the agent reads are sent to your LLM
  provider. Don't point the workspace at a directory containing secrets.
- **Your provider's handling of your data.** That is between you and them; jaigent adds
  no intermediary.
- **Anyone who can reach an exposed gateway.** A `jgt-` key grants full agent access —
  file tools, web access, and the shell if you enabled it — inside the server's
  workspace, billed to your provider account. Treat one like a production credential.
  Binding `jaigent serve` to `0.0.0.0` hands that access to your whole network,
  which is why it requires a key; `--no-auth` is only ever accepted on loopback.
- **Scheduled tasks.** They run unattended with approval forced to `auto`, so they can
  write files without anyone confirming. Their changes are still checkpointed.
- **Side effects of shell commands.** Checkpoints cover files touched through the
  agent's own file tools. A `run_command` invocation could change anything on the
  machine, so nothing is snapshotted for it and `undo` cannot help. Commit before
  running a task with `--allow-shell`.
- **Exfiltration to a public host.** The SSRF guard stops the agent reaching *inward*.
  It cannot stop a model from sending workspace contents to an attacker-controlled
  public URL if a prompt injection convinces it to. Review what the agent fetches
  when the task involves untrusted pages.
- **File permissions on Windows.** POSIX mode bits do not exist there; NTFS
  inheritance governs access to `.env` and the key store instead.
- **A hostile GitHub release.** `jaigent update` runs the official installer script,
  which verifies the published checksum — but anyone who can publish a release to this
  repository can publish a binary. That is the same trust you extend to any package
  manager. Pin a version if that matters to you.
- **A compromised provider endpoint.** If you point `--base-url` at a host you do not
  control, it sees every prompt and can return anything, including tool calls the
  agent will then execute. Only use base URLs you trust.

## Good practice

- Run in a dedicated directory, not `$HOME` or `/`.
- Keep the workspace under version control so you can review and revert changes.
- Start with `--verbose` to see what the agent actually does.
- Leave `--allow-shell` off unless you need it and trust the task.
- Use a scoped API key with a spending limit.
- Run `jaigent doctor` after installing or upgrading; it checks key configuration,
  storage permissions and which providers are actually reachable.
- Verify the checksum if you download a release binary by hand. The installer scripts
  do this for you.
- Keep `jaigent` up to date. Every version is supported, but fixes land in the newest
  patch release first.
- Keep `jaigent serve` on loopback unless you have put real authentication and TLS in
  front of it. Issue one gateway key per application so you can revoke them
  individually with `jaigent keys revoke`, and check `jaigent keys list` for calls you
  do not recognise.
