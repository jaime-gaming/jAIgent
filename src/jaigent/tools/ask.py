"""Let the model ask the user a question mid-run, with a dedicated prompt UI.

File approvals already interrupt the run with a diff; this is the equivalent
for *choices* — a missing preference, an ambiguous target, a fork with real
consequences.

With options and a terminal, the question renders as an arrow-key picker:
``↑``/``↓`` move, Enter confirms, digits jump-pick, and Esc switches to typing
a free-form answer. Once answered, the panel collapses into a single summary
line, so the transcript stays compact. Without a terminal — or with an open
question — it falls back to a numbered panel and a typed prompt.

Where nobody can answer (``serve``, schedules, pipes, MCP), the tool says so
and the model proceeds with its best judgment instead of blocking forever.
