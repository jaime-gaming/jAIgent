"""A shared task plan the model maintains for multi-step work.

``write_todos`` replaces the whole plan on every call: the model sends the full
list with updated statuses, the way it would rewrite a checklist on a
whiteboard. The CLI renders the new list the moment it arrives, so the plan is
visible live while the agent works.

Stateless by design. The latest call in the conversation holds the current
plan, so there is nothing to persist, migrate, or keep in sync — and nothing
for ``/workspace`` switches or ``/resume`` to carry over.
