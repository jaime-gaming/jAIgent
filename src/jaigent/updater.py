"""Checking for, and installing, new versions of jAIgent.

Two rules shape everything here:

1. **A version check must never get in the way.** It runs at most once a day, in
   the background, with a short timeout, and any failure is swallowed. Being
   offline, behind a proxy, or rate-limited by GitHub must never slow down or
   break a command the user actually asked for.
2. **Nothing is installed without consent.** ``jaigent update`` is an explicit
   command. The passive check only ever prints one line telling you a release
   exists.

The install method is detected rather than assumed: a pip install is upgraded
with pip, a standalone binary is replaced by re-running the platform installer.
Guessing wrong would either fail confusingly or, worse, leave two jAIgents on
the PATH.
