"""Human-in-the-loop approval for destructive tool calls.

The agent can write and delete files. In ``ask`` mode — the default for
interactive use — jAIgent shows a unified diff of what is about to change and
waits for a yes or no. ``--yes`` skips the prompt for automation, ``--dry-run``
refuses every mutation while still letting the agent read and search.

The policy is enforced in one place, :class:`Approver`, which the agent consults
before running any tool marked ``dangerous`` or listed in :data:`MUTATING_TOOLS`.
