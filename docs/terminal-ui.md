# The terminal UI

What each element on screen is, every key it answers to, and what it degrades
to when the terminal cannot keep up. Screens and keystrokes here match what
ships; if a picture and the code disagree, the code wins and this page is a
bug.

## The anatomy of a turn

```
❯ summarise notes.md into summary.md        ← your prompt
  → Reading files · notes.md  ✓             ← tool trace (one line per call)
  → Searching the web · jaigent release notes  ✓
⠋ Thinking…  ▰▰▱▱▱                        4s · ↑ 1.2k tokens   ← live status line
                                             (erases itself; counters pinned right)

Done. summary.md now holds the…              ← the answer, rendered live as markdown
· 3 tool calls · 4,120 tokens (3,800 in / 320 out) · ~$0.0008   ← the footer
```

## The prompt line

`❯` (or `>` on a console that cannot print it). Empty Enter sends nothing —
pressing it repeatedly is free. End a line with `\` to keep typing; the
continuation marker is `…`. Leave with Ctrl-D, Ctrl-C at the prompt, or
`/exit`. Anything starting `/` is a command (see `/help`); paths like
`/tmp/notes.md` are not — they are ordinary prompts.

The prompt is **locked while a turn runs**. The terminal stops echoing, so
typing does not smear across the answer, and what was typed is discarded
before the prompt comes back rather than pre-filling it. The status line says
`input locked` while that holds. A question put to you — an approval diff,
`ask_user` — releases the lock until it is answered. Ctrl-C is never
swallowed; it interrupts the turn.

The lock is applied to the line discipline (`ECHO` off and the pending input
flushed on POSIX, the console echo flag and input buffer on Windows), and only
when stdin is a terminal — see `src/jaigent/input_lock.py`.

## The status line

While the model works, one line redraws in place: a spinner, the current
verb, and — pinned to the right edge — elapsed time and the token count so
far. When a tool runs, the verb becomes the action and its target:

```
⠙ Reading files… · src/app.py                            2s · ↑ 15.3k tokens
⠹ Searching the web… · python 3.13 release date          7s
⠸ Thinking…  ▰▱▱▱▱                    4s · ↑ 1.2k tokens · input locked
```

The idle verbs (`Thinking`, `Orbiting`, `Weaving`, …) rotate from a pool in
`src/jaigent/ui.py` — `PHRASES`. On a narrow terminal the right side is
dropped a piece at a time, never wrapped: a status line that wraps leaves a
stale row behind on every frame. At any moment exactly one thing owns the
screen — the status line, a live answer block, or a question panel — and each
one yields cleanly to the next, so the spinner keeps spinning during tools
even after text has already streamed.

## The tool trace

Every finished tool call leaves one quiet line: the action, the short target,
and the outcome. `✓` when it worked, `✗` when it returned an error the model
will read and recover from. This is the record of what the agent actually
did; `--verbose` trades it for the full argument dumps.

## The task plan

For multi-step work the model keeps a checklist with `write_todos`, and every
update prints the whole plan while the agent works — the header counts what
is done, `✓` marks finished tasks, `◉` the one in progress, `○` the rest:

```
  → Plan · 1 of 3 done  ✓
    ✓ Scaffold the routes
    ◉ Wire up login
    ○ Add tests
```

## Streaming

Answers render as markdown live, while each chunk arrives — a code fence or
table takes shape on screen instead of flashing as raw markup first. A reply
that narrates and *then* calls a tool ("Let me check the files…") suspends
its live block for the tool and resumes below a blank line, so narration and
answer never run together. `--no-stream` waits for the full reply instead.

## What goes on which stream

The answer is the payload; the trace lines, the footer and the limit panels
are progress about getting to it. On a terminal there is one stream, so they
sit together. When stdout is a pipe they separate: the answer goes to stdout
and everything else to stderr, so `jaigent "…" > answer.md` writes a file
containing the answer and nothing else. Piped output is never rendered as
markdown either, so the file gets the source.

## Approvals

A mutating tool call (write, edit, delete, shell) in `ask` mode interrupts
with a unified diff of what is about to change:

```
╭───────────────────── write_file ─────────────────────╮
│ summary.md  new file                                 │
│ --- a/summary.md                                     │
│ +++ b/summary.md                                     │

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
Apply this change? [y]es / [n]o / [a]lways / [q]uit:
```

`a` stops asking for that tool for the rest of the run; `q` cancels the run.
The snapshot for `undo` is taken *before* this prompt, so approving and then
reverting is always possible.

## The `ask_user` picker

When the model asks a question with options, it renders as a panel you answer
with the keyboard instead of typing numbers:

```
╭─────────────────── jAI has a question ───────────────╮
│ Which database should the migration target?          │
│                                                      │
│     ○ PostgreSQL                                     │
│   ❯ ◉ SQLite (local file)                            │
│     ○ MariaDB                                        │
│                                                      │
│ ↑↓ move · 1-3 pick · enter confirm · esc own answer  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

The selected row carries the `❯` pointer and a marker that slowly pulses, so
the prompt reads as waiting rather than frozen. Once answered, the whole panel
collapses into one line that outlives it:

```
✓ Which database should the migration target? → SQLite (local file)
```

Open questions (no options) skip the picker and go straight to a typed
answer, with the question echoed on the prompt line so it is not lost.

### Keys

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` | move the pointer (wraps at both ends) |
| `j` / `k` | same, for vim hands |
| `1`–`6` | jump straight to that option and pick it |
| `Enter` | confirm the highlighted option |
| `Esc` / `e` / `Tab` | type your own answer instead |
| `Ctrl-C` | cancel the question — and the run, like quitting an approval |
| `Ctrl-D` | close the prompt; the model proceeds with its best judgment |

An empty typed answer means "use your judgment"; the model is told exactly
that, in the same words the non-interactive hosts get.

## Degradation — the contract

The UI must never crash over what a terminal cannot print. Every decoration
has an ASCII fallback, chosen by what the output stream can actually encode:

| You have | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| A modern UTF-8 terminal | everything above, in colour |
| `--no-color` | the same layout, unstyled; no animation, raw streaming text |
| A legacy Windows code page (cp1252 …) | `→` becomes `->`, `✓` becomes `OK`, `●`/`○`/`◉` become `(*)`/`( )`/`(+)` |
| A pipe instead of a tty | plain text, no spinner, no live rendering; the answer on stdout, progress on stderr |
| No tty on stdin (`serve`, schedules) | `ask_user` never prompts; the model is told nobody can answer |
| MCP | `ask_user` is not offered at all — there is no user behind the protocol |

Non-interactive hosts force approvals to `auto` (or refuse them, in dry-run)
for the same reason: there is no keyboard to consult, so pretending otherwise
would hang the run.

## Quick reference

| Where | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Chat prompt | Enter send · `\` continue · empty Enter nothing · Ctrl-D / `/exit` leave |
| During a turn | the prompt is locked — typing is ignored · Ctrl-C interrupts the turn, not the chat |
| Approval prompt | `y` / `n` / `a` / `q` |
| `ask_user` picker | arrows · digits · Enter · Esc · Ctrl-C |
| In chat, any time | `/help` lists every command with a one-line effect |
